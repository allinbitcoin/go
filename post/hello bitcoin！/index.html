<h4 id="what-is-bitcoin">What is Bitcoin?</h4>
<p>Bitcoin is a consensus network that enables a new payment system and a completely digital money. It is the first decentralized peer-to-peer payment network that is powered by its users with no central authority or middlemen. From a user perspective, Bitcoin is pretty much like cash for the Internet. Bitcoin can also be seen as the most prominent triple entry bookkeeping system in existence.</p>
<h4 id="who-created-bitcoin">Who created Bitcoin?</h4>
<p>Bitcoin is the first implementation of a concept called &quot;cryptocurrency&quot;, which was first described in 1998 by Wei Dai on the cypherpunks mailing list, suggesting the idea of a new form of money that uses cryptography to control its creation and transactions, rather than a central authority. The first Bitcoin specification and proof of concept was published in 2009 in a cryptography mailing list by Satoshi Nakamoto. Satoshi left the project in late 2010 without revealing much about himself. The community has since grown exponentially with many developers working on Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Satoshi's anonymity often raised unjustified concerns, many of which are linked to misunderstanding of the open-source nature of Bitcoin. The Bitcoin protocol and software are published openly and any developer around the world can review the code or make their own modified version of the Bitcoin software. Just like current developers, Satoshi's influence was limited to the changes he made being adopted by others and therefore he did not control Bitcoin. As such, the identity of Bitcoin's inventor is probably as relevant today as the identity of the person who invented paper.</p>
<h4 id="who-controls-the-bitcoin-network">Who controls the Bitcoin network?</h4>
<p>Nobody owns the Bitcoin network much like no one owns the technology behind email. Bitcoin is controlled by all Bitcoin users around the world. While developers are improving the software, they can't force a change in the Bitcoin protocol because all users are free to choose what software and version they use. In order to stay compatible with each other, all users need to use software complying with the same rules. Bitcoin can only work correctly with a complete consensus among all users. Therefore, all users and developers have a strong incentive to protect this consensus.</p>
<h4 id="how-does-bitcoin-work">How does Bitcoin work?</h4>
<p>From a user perspective, Bitcoin is nothing more than a mobile app or computer program that provides a personal Bitcoin wallet and allows a user to send and receive bitcoins with them. This is how Bitcoin works for most users.</p>
<p>Behind the scenes, the Bitcoin network is sharing a public ledger called the &quot;block chain&quot;. This ledger contains every transaction ever processed, allowing a user's computer to verify the validity of each transaction. The authenticity of each transaction is protected by digital signatures corresponding to the sending addresses, allowing all users to have full control over sending bitcoins from their own Bitcoin addresses. In addition, anyone can process transactions using the computing power of specialized hardware and earn a reward in bitcoins for this service. This is often called &quot;mining&quot;. To learn more about Bitcoin, you can consult the dedicated page and the original paper.</p>
<h5 id="actual-circulation">Actual Circulation.</h5>
<p>In terms of supply, there are 21 million bitcoins in total, of which 17.8 million are currently in circulation, but there are 4 million bitcoins that are permanently lost for various reasons, and because of the large number of users who hoard bitcoins, there is not much circulation on the actual exchange.</p>
<h4 id="bitcoin-value">Bitcoin Value</h4>
<h5 id="value-storage">Value Storage</h5>
<p>Compared to other competing products such as gold, diamonds, and fiat currency, bitcoin has the advantages of decentralization, inflation prevention, open transaction books, a certain degree of anonymity, and easy storage and transportation.</p>
<h5 id="international-remittances">international remittances</h5>
<p>Transnational remittances are one of the earliest scenarios for Bitcoin, which is capable of processing borderless digital cash transactions in minutes at a much lower cost than traditional financial service providers, and will gain market share in the remittance market in the future.</p>
<h5 id="speculation-tools">Speculation Tools</h5>
<p>There are many different kinds of investments, including gold, antiques, art, real estate, early stage startups, and shares of public companies .......</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Apple is now a trillion-dollar market cap company, with 28,834,582 shares traded daily over the past 52 weeks, or about $5.77 billion at July 2019 prices of about $200 per lot.</p>
<p>Bitcoin's circulating market capitalization on July 10, 2019 was approximately $224.7 billion, less than a quarter of Apple's; however, Bitcoin's daily trading volume was $29.47 billion, more than five times the daily trading volume of Apple's stock. ......</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The most important thing in speculative markets is liquidity, and Bitcoin is inherently liquid.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are now thousands of blockchain digital asset exchanges around the world; 2018 coin profits as good as NASDAQ</p>
<p>24 hours a day, 365 days a year, never closed.</p>
<p>More and more traders around the world in the future ......</p>

<h5 id="interpretation">Interpretation</h5>
<ol>
<li>January 2013 bitcoin price of $13, with a peak of $1,163 in December, an increase of 8,946%.</li>
<li>2014 correction to a low of $152 in January 2015, down 86.93%; but still ten times higher than the start of the rise</li>
<li>the market began to climb in 2016, reaching its 2013 peak in early 2017, and peaked at $19,666 by the end of 2017, up 12938%.</li>
<li>2018 retracement with a low of 3122usdt and now 10300 has risen to half of its high.</li>
</ol>
<h5 id="summary">Summary</h5>
<ol>
<li>due to t+0 &amp; 7x24h trading, bitcoin has huge volatility compared to traditional investment targets, and has a stable upward trend over the cycle.</li>
<li>the lowest retracement of the current round is higher than the highest of the previous round (a condition for wave theory)</li>
<li>each round of the market has nearly a hundred times the increase in amplitude, the last round of more than 86 times the market, looking back now is only a small adjustment in the upward trend (long-term optimism).</li>
</ol>
<h5 id="future-outlook">Future Outlook</h5>
<ol>
<li>Bitcoin's current market capitalization of RMB 1.3 trillion is too small for a global investment.</li>
<li>This year's exchange reports indicate that institutional investors continue to enter the market and foreign funds are manipulating bitcoin.</li>
<li>the continued devaluation of the renminbi, the international situation is unstable, bitcoin's hedging properties, risk aversion and fomo sentiment continue to drive bitcoin to rise</li>
<li>bitcoin continues to flow into the hands of hoarders, and with the early morning loss of coins, the real amount of bitcoin in circulation will become less and less.<br>
The current price of bitcoin is severely undervalued, given the absolute superiority of bitcoin reserves over gold, currency, and real estate.</li>
</ol>
<p>The main purpose is to hedge risks. We also have our own quantitative program to pursue more profits under the premise of stability.</p>
<h4 id="industry-barriers">Industry Barriers</h4>
<p>Data shows that perhaps less than one in 10,000 of the average person is able to participate in this feast of quality stocks.</p>
<p>This is true for the stock market, not to mention the bitcoin market, which is still in its early stages. Due to ambiguous government regulations, it is difficult for ordinary people to enter the market.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How do I choose an exchange?</p>
<p>What if the exchange does not support fiat currency?</p>
<p>How do you choose a pile of stable coins?</p>
<p>Off-site purchase process?</p>
<p>Which currency to buy?</p>
<p>How to catch up with the ups and downs, leveraged out of the warehouse?</p>
<p>What if the team runs away from a primary market investment?</p>
<p>I don't want to play cash out bank card is frozen how to do?</p>
<p>@......@</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Many people enter from pyramid coins, cottage exchanges, and pay a lot of introductory fees in a muddle.</p>
<p>Then the secondary market was harvested again, paying a lot of tuition.</p>
<p>These are all unnecessary in our opinion</p>

<p>Maotai's stock has risen tenfold in four years, but most people just talk about it and don't get involved, not for lack of money to buy, nor for lack of time.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>may have been tempted to buy Maotai stock at some point in the year.</p>
<p>But then I turned around and thought.</p>
<p>Still have to go to a brokerage house to open an account, bind a bank card, and sign a bunch of agreements ......</p>
<p>It's a pain in the ass, maybe some other time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Bitcoin Fund was created to address this pain point, participate in the fund, then eat and sleep on time, and anyone can get a piece of the pie!</p>
